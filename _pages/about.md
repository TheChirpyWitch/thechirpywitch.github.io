I’m a PhD student in Computational Sciences & Informatics at **George Mason University**, advised by **Robert Axtell**. I build computational models that combine **agent-based modeling (ABM)** with **machine learning (ML)** and **natural language processing (NLP)** to study **trust, information flows, and governance** in socio-technical systems.

**Research interests:** ABM, Computational Social Science, Trust & Governance, Misinformation, NLP, ML, Climate & Policy.

### Recent News
- **2025** — *AgentZero++: Modeling Fear-Based Behavior in Social Systems* awarded **Best Paper** at **CSSSA 2025**. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05185)
- **2025** — *Modeling Societal Collapse: A Multi-Society Agent-Based Exploration of
Resource, Innovation, and Governance Feedbacks*. CSSSA Poster

### Current Projects
- **Misinformation as a Commons Problem** — modeling trust and attention as shared resources, examining extraction dynamics in information ecosystems, and evaluating governance interventions for epistemic resilience.
- **Conspiracy Evolution Pipeline** — modeling narrative shift from conspiracy to propaganda via temporal semantic drift and frame analysis.
- **Climate-Related Policy Analysis** — NLP for ocean-acidification policy **intent classification** and governance-gap mapping.
- **Climate Migration ABM** — simulating household adaptation strategies under climate stress and socioeconomic differentials.
